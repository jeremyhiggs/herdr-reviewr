# QA-installing a local build

How to run a locally built `herdr-reviewr` inside the real herdr panes. Follow it exactly. Every
step exists because skipping it has broken a session before.

The installed plugin lives at `~/.config/herdr/plugins/github/persiyanov.reviewr-<hash>/`. Its
pane and its actions run `bin/herdr-reviewr` from that directory, as its `herdr-plugin.toml`
says. QA means swapping those two files and restarting the panes. herdr rereads the manifest on
every plugin call, so a manifest change takes effect on the next keypress, with no herdr
restart.

## The one command

```
just qa-install
```

It builds the release binary, swaps it into the installed plugin, verifies the swap actually
runs, and prints what remains manual. The steps it performs, and why each one is load-bearing:

1. `cargo build --release`.
2. Refuse when the running herdr is older than the manifest's `min_herdr_version`. herdr marks
   a plugin whose manifest asks for a newer herdr as unavailable, which would take away every
   reviewr pane and action until the manifest is restored.
3. Back up the original binary to `bin/herdr-reviewr.release-backup` and the original manifest
   to `herdr-plugin.toml.release-backup`, each only if no backup exists yet. A later run never
   overwrites the pristine release with an earlier QA build.
4. Replace the binary **through a new inode**: `rm`, `cp` to a staging name, `mv` into place,
   then `codesign --force --sign -` on macOS.
5. Run `bin/herdr-reviewr --action close` outside any workspace, over an empty config dir, and
   require its refusal ("invoke from inside herdr") before touching any pane. A killed binary
   prints nothing.
6. Copy this checkout's `herdr-plugin.toml` over the installed one, through a staging name, so
   herdr never reads a half-written manifest. The manifest names the commands the pane and the
   actions run, so a build that changes them is only exercised with its own manifest.
7. Print the pids of running panes still on the old binary.

## Rule 1: never overwrite the binary in place

`cp target/release/herdr-reviewr <plugin>/bin/herdr-reviewr` onto an existing file keeps the old
inode. macOS caches code-signing state by inode, decides the file was tampered with, and
SIGKILLs it at every launch. The symptom: panes open and instantly die, the actions do
nothing, and the binary exits 137 with no output. Nothing in
the logs says why. Always `rm` first and move a fresh file in.

## Rule 2: replacing the file does not touch running panes

A running pane keeps executing the binary image it was launched with, however many times the
file on disk changes. Refreshing inside reviewr (`r`) or reloading the herdr client does
nothing. Each reviewr pane must be closed and reopened. `pgrep -f herdr-reviewr` with start
times tells you which panes are still old.

## Rule 3: only the user restarts panes

The plugin's `open` and `toggle` actions act on the **focused workspace**, whatever
`HERDR_WORKSPACE_ID` says. Scripting them from outside herdr stacks every new pane into
whichever workspace happens to be focused. Closing is safe
(`herdr plugin action invoke close --plugin persiyanov.reviewr` sweeps the focused workspace's
reviewr panes), but opening is not. After the swap, tell the user: press the reviewr toggle in
each space you want on the new build. Do not automate it.

The Windows VM below is the one exception: no user sits at its herdr, so a script opens panes
there.

## Verify

- `env -u HERDR_WORKSPACE_ID HERDR_PLUGIN_CONFIG_DIR="$(mktemp -d)" <plugin>/bin/herdr-reviewr --action close`
  prints `reviewr: no workspace context (invoke from inside herdr)`.
- `herdr plugin action invoke close --plugin persiyanov.reviewr` answers from the new manifest:
  its log entry ran `bin/herdr-reviewr --action close`.
- After the user reopens a pane, `ps -o lstart= -p $(pgrep -f herdr-reviewr)` shows a start
  time later than the swap.

## Rollback

```
just qa-restore
```

It swaps the release binary back through a fresh inode and restores the release manifest.
Then close and reopen the panes, same as any other swap. A full reinstall
(`herdr plugin install persiyanov/herdr-reviewr`) also restores the released binary.

## Windows

Windows QA runs in a local VM, not on the user's machine: Windows 11 ARM64 under QEMU with
Apple's hypervisor. herdr's Windows build is x64, and ARM64 Windows runs it under emulation,
the same way a user on an ARM laptop gets it. The automated suite stays on CI's
`windows-latest`. The VM covers what only a real seat shows: paste, mouse, editors, and a real
plugin install.

Build the VM once, unattended, in about 30 minutes (needs `brew install qemu` and 40 GB free):

```
scripts/windows-vm/create.sh
```

It downloads the Windows ISO from Microsoft, installs Windows with no setup screens, and leaves
a local admin `reviewr` logged in with OpenSSH, Git for Windows, and herdr. The VM lives in
`~/VMs/reviewr-windows` (`VM_DIR` overrides it).

| To | Run |
| --- | --- |
| Start it after a Mac restart | `scripts/windows-vm/run-vm.sh` |
| Run PowerShell in it | `scripts/windows-vm/vm '<command>'` |
| Watch the screen | Screen Sharing to `vnc://127.0.0.1:5905`, password `reviewr` (loopback only) |
| Type into the desktop | `scripts/windows-vm/vmkeys.py '<text>' --enter` |
| Screenshot the desktop | `printf 'screendump /tmp/vm.png -f png\n' \| nc -U ~/VMs/reviewr-windows/monitor.sock` |

A QA build is a cross-compile on the Mac (`cargo install cargo-xwin` once), copied in:

```
cargo xwin build --release --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
```

Run a pane journey with `scripts/windows-herdr.ps1` copied into the VM, the same harness the
CI smoke uses. Rules 1 and 2 apply inside the VM too, and rule 3's exception lets the journey open
the panes it drives: no user sits at that seat.
